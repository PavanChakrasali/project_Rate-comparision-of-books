The data is extracted in raw HTML format, which must be carefully parsed and reduce the noise from the raw data.
The initial step is to find the URL that you want to scrap. Here we are extracting book details from the flipkart. The URL of this page is https://www.flipkart.com/indian-woman/p/itmdwuhbkmgugwjv?pid='+id.
